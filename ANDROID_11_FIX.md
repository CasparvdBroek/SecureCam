# Android 11 Video Freeze Fix

## Problem Description

On Android 11 (API level 30), the SecureCam app experiences video freezing issues when starting the camera. This is due to new background restrictions and foreground service requirements introduced in Android 11.

## Root Cause

Android 11 introduced stricter restrictions for accessing camera and microphone from background services:

1. **Foreground Service Type Requirements**: Apps targeting Android 11+ must declare specific foreground service types (`camera` and `microphone`) in the AndroidManifest.xml

2. **Background Access Restrictions**: If a foreground service is started while the app is in the background, it cannot access camera or microphone unless specific conditions are met

3. **New Permissions**: Android 11+ requires explicit permissions for foreground services that access camera and microphone

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated AndroidManifest.xml

**Added Foreground Service Permissions:**
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE" />
```

**Updated Foreground Service Declaration:**
```xml
<service
    android:name=".ForegroundService"
    android:enabled="true"
    android:exported="false"
    android:foregroundServiceType="camera|microphone|dataSync" />
```

### 2. Key Changes Made

- **Before**: `android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync"`
- **After**: `android:foregroundServiceType="camera|microphone|dataSync"`

This explicitly declares that the foreground service will access camera and microphone, which is required for Android 11+ compatibility.

## Technical Details

### Android 11 Background Restrictions

According to Android documentation:
- If your app targets Android 11 or higher and accesses the camera or microphone in a foreground service, you must include the camera and microphone foreground service types
- If your app starts a foreground service while running in the background, the foreground service cannot access the microphone or camera

### Why This Fixes the Video Freeze

1. **Proper Service Declaration**: The system now knows the service will access camera/microphone
2. **Permission Validation**: Android 11+ can properly validate the service has the right to access these resources
3. **Background Access**: When the service is started from the foreground (via MainActivity), it maintains camera access rights

## Testing

After applying these changes:
1. Build and install the app
2. Start the service from the main activity (foreground)
3. Camera should initialize without freezing on Android 11+ devices
